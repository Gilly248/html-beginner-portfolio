<h1>Top 3 Movies according to Liam</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr>

<H3>Harry Potter (all of them)</H3>
<p>All harry potter movies combined should be considered as one movie as it tells a story from start to finish over seveal years.</p>

<H3>Troy</H3>
<p>It is something different to Harry Potter but this film captures an important time period in history and it is badass</p>

<H3>Maze Runner</H3>
<p>Completely differenmt to the previous films but what an amazing story</p>
